# Cloudinary transformations

The syntax for transforming and delivering videos is generally similar to that for images, and you can apply the
majority of available image transformations to video as well. For example, you can resize, crop, rotate, set video
quality and format or use auto quality and/or auto format, add text or image overlays to your videos, and more.

There are also a number of special options you can use for transforming and delivering video content. For example, you
can adjust their size, shape, speed, duration, quality, and appearance. There are also some features that are specific
to audio.
